        <p2><br><br>Choosing the perfect perfume is an intimate and personal experience that can elevate your style and leave a lasting impression. <br><br>
            When embarking on your fragrance journey, it's crucial to grasp the composition of perfumes and how they can suit your preferences. Perfumes are meticulously crafted using a combination of natural and synthetic components that blend harmoniously to create a distinctive scent profile. By understanding the different fragrance families, such as floral, oriental, woody, or fresh, and the natural essences composing each family you can narrow down your favourite essences and create a perfume that resonates with your unique style and preferences.

Consider also factors like the longevity and overall intensity you wish to have to ensure it aligns with your preferences. Experiment different scent notes and their intensity to make sure you use only the ones that fits you. In this way you will know how to pick the right cologne that truly suits you.<br>

        <p8><br><br><b>Consider The Season and Occasion.</b></p8>
        <p3><br><br>Perfumes interact with your body chemistry in a unique way, making it essential to consider how a fragrance will evolve on your skin. Factors such as skin type, pH level , level of water or melanin and natural body odor can influence how a perfume smell on you.

            <br><br>Understanding your skin type  and your pH level is crucial in the process of choosing a cologne that suits you.<br>
             These factors can guide you towards fragrances that complement your unique chemistry. For instance, oily skin and dark skin tend to retain scents longer and pair well with oriental, heavy fragrances or those with spices, sweetness, floriental, balsamic, musky, and leathery notes.<br>
              On the other hand, dry, fair, and often acidic skin may benefit from more citrusy, green, ozonic, aromatic, fruity, floral, and woody notes. By experimenting with different perfume families, you can discover the colognes that best suit your body chemistry.<br>

        <p4><br><b>*Tip:</b> When testing perfumes, apply them to your pulse points and allow them to develop on your skin for a few hours.Observe how the scent evolves during this time before making a final decision.<br></p4>
        <p5><br><b>Consider Asking for recommendations.</b></p5>
        <p6><br><br><b>*Tip:</b> Do not blind buy.<br></p6>
        <p7><br><b>It is important to store your perfume in a cool and dark place, shielded from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures.</b><br></p7>

        <h5><br><br>My Top 5 perfumes</h5>
        <p9><br><br><b>1. Tom Ford Oud Wood</b><br><br></p9>
        <img src="oudd.jpg" , class="fixx" , width="400" , height="400" >
        <br><br>
        <p11>Tom Ford Oud Wood is a mysterious, soft, spicy, creamy oud scent. It's bold and masculine. The best TF in my opinion. Perfect for cold weather and everyday use. The design is also stunning and you can expect the mysterious smell just by looking at the bottle. The Sillage is moderate and the longevity is poor(because of the reformulation). Even with a poor longevity this is still a 10 out of 10 for me.<br>
        </p11>
        <br>
        <p8><b>2. Amouage Interlude Black Iris</b><br><br></p8>
        <img src="interlude.jpg" , class="fixx" , width="400" , height="400" >
        <br>
        <p12> Amouage Interlude Black Iris
            The best perfume I have ever tried. It has a powdery, spicy, woody, leathery smell. The opening is amber, leather and iris to me, I can also smell myrhh(a kind of incense), rosemary and oud. Unique blend of notes, mysterious and luxurious scent; not suitable for everyday wear and definitely not for summer or spring, it’s gonna have the best performance in cold weather more specifically in the winter. Impressive design, you can expect a quality perfume just by seeing the bootle; what I am finding interesting is that the cap of the bottle won’t close if it’s not on the right position(the magnets will reject eachother). Amazing sillage and longevity. I love it and it is also my signature fragrance.
        <br><br></p12>
        <p13><b>3. Miller Harris Scherzo</b><br><br></p13>
        <img src="scherzo.jpg" , width="400" , height="400" , class="fixx">
        <br>
        <p14>All I have to say about Miller Harris Scherzo is that it lasts forever and it smells divine.</p14>
        <br><br>
        <p15><b>4. Guerlain L'Homme Idéal Extrême</b></p15>
        <br><br>
        <img src="plummy.jpg" , class="fixx" , height="400" , width="400" >
        <br>
        <p16> Guerlain L'Homme Idéal Extrême is a strong almond scent with plum, pink pepper and tobacco notes and a bit leathery that may not appeal everyone. Unique and elegant. The bottle is absolutely gorgeous. Best blind-buy ever.<br></p16>
        <br>
        <p17><b>5. Lalique Encre Noire</b></p17>
        <br><br>

        <br>
        <p18>Lalique Encre Noire
            I have so many words to describe this fragrance. Dark, smoky, earthy, gothic scent. It smells like you just walked into the woods at night. It’s elegant and unique, I haven’t smelled something like this ever, surprisingly good for it’s price, this is the only perfume I would recommend to someone that wants something cheap and uncommon. Strong scent but yet fresh, again like the other fragrances in my collection may not be on everyone’s taste. Amazing design, the black bottle with the wood cap with a craving in it with the name of the brand, the bottle looks exactly like the scent. The projection is pretty good, but don’t expect a good logevity, after all it is eau de toillete. I’m giving it a 10/10, unexpected rating I would say, even if it is not long lasting I just love it.<br></p18>
