      <h2><br><br>Designer</h2>
      <p1><br>Big-name fashion houses such as Dior and Chanel are considered designers in the fragrance world. These mainstream brands are often shopped in the mayor boutiques and stores.<br></p1>

      </div>
      <p2><br>These fashion houses(car brands, cosmetics etc.) make other products along side with fragrances such as: watches, cosmetics, clothes, shoes, accesories.
        These products are produced at a much bigger scale and are more well-known to the general population. Even though designers lack so to speak, the “luxury“, they excel on availability, price, and popularity which shouldn’t be ignored.
        Mainstream fragrances are produced in the biggest fragrance factories which guarantee control quality which sometimes, may be absent in a niche world.
        In the fragrance community, designers are often named “gateway drug” which hooks you into this hobby.

    <div class="niche">
      <h3><br><br>Niche</h3>
      <p3>
        <br>Companies that sell fragrances exclusively are niche brands. These companies sell their products to a specialized sub-market that satisfies specific needs, often with bigger price tags.
        <br>
        <br>Unlike the designers, which attract a much bigger population, a niche audience is smaller and more demanding. <br>
        <br>Brands such as Amouage and Frederic Malle are great examples of what a niche fragrance company is. They are commonly not present in most retail stores, their price is often higher and offers exclusivity.

      <p4><br><br>One of the things which are still present in a niche world is artistic expression and creativity. Which means they are at a danger of being not accepted by its target population.

      <h4>Indie Brands: A New Alternative<br><br></h4>
      <p5>Indie brands are somewhat new to the fragrance world. Often named a niche from its golden days. These are small and independent brands, often run by a few people.
        People that start an indie brand are almost always self-taught perfumers who alongside a person or two are in charge of everything from perfume creation, marketing, acquiring oils, manufacturing, and perfume distribution.
        Nowadays, everything that is not a mass-produced designer is called a niche, and you would be right if you’d called an indie brand like Tauer Perfumes a niche brand.
        Artisans like the above-mentioned Andy Tauer make his fragrances by hand in his home country Switzerland. On the other hand, not every indie brand is “homemade” and some do choose to produce their perfumes in fragrance factories.
        <br><br>
        One of the good things about small distribution is the ability to avoid IFRA regulations. This way, the fragrance users are able to experience banned or limited notes in their natural way.

      <h5><br>Layering perfumes<br></h5>
      <p9><br>Layering perfume means that you spray multiple fragrances on you, that have the same base notes and different top and middle notes, to obtain a unique scent.
        <br>It is often used to create a signature scent.</p9>

    <div class="correct">
      <h6><br>How to apply perfume correctly<br></h6>
      <p10><br>I call it "the holy trinity", basically you spray once behind each ear and behind your neck, this makes your fragrance noticeable for the others when you walk up into a room; if you are going out or you just want to smell stronger spray one time on each of your shoudlers(on the clothes); if you want to be able to feel your fragrance too throughout the day spray it on your neck too. Indeed you are going to get used to the smell and you will get the impression that it doesn't last.<br>
        <br>All these things are based on the performance of the perfume, the sillage and longevity.<br><br></p10>
      <p12><b>Starting a Perfume Collection</b><br><br></p12>
      <p11>A perfume collection has to start with 4 fragrances at least; one for special ocassions, one for everyday use, one for cold weather and one for hot weather.<br<br>
       <br><br> Why do you need one for each type of weather?<br><br>
        The answer is simple, winter fragrances for example have a heavier scent that was made for it's best performance in cold weather. Heat causes fragrances to evaporate faster and project farther. If a fragrance is heavy and strong in the summer it can be overwhelming so most people consider them winter fragrances.
        Summer fragrances are lighter, more fresh and floral, they tend to get muted by colder weather. <br><br></p11>
        <img src="collection1.jpg" , width="1150">
      <p13><br><br>Indeed there are fragrances versatile that you can use in any season and ocassion so you don't have to buy multiple perfumes. Having a collection is a choice and it is expensive especially if you are more into niche.

    <p17><b>Fragrance Maceration</b><br></p17>
    <p18><br>Maceration is also known as the process of oxidising your fragrance. This enables the alcohol in your new bottle of perfume to evaporate. Often, perfume houses will macerate alcohol based scents in their factories and this is a controlled procedure carried out by themselves. But once in a while, certain perfumes may require just a little bit more maceration.<br>
    <br><b>How to Macerate your Fragrance</b><br><br>Macerating your perfume is not as complicated as it sounds, and there’s no art or learning curve to it. When you’ve opened a new bottle of perfume and upon spritzing it on, and you’re not satisfied that the fragrance is coming through fully, this is time for you to macerate your perfume. <br>
  <br>
  Don’t put that bottle back. Continue to pump out 5 to 10 pumps into the air, making sure you’re fully pressing on the nozzle. All you have to do after this step is to close the bottle and place it back in the original box. The next thing you have to do is to store the perfume in the box in a cool and dry place for 1 month. Make sure you’re keeping it away from any sunlight. The back of a cabinet or drawer in your bedroom is an ideal place to store your perfume that’s macerating. Don’t leave it in the bathroom as the hot and humid air is not ideal for perfumes. If you’re able to place the fragrance in a cabinet or drawer that you don’t open often, that’s even better. Over the period of 1 month, the scent will get stronger and darken slightly in colour, giving you the ideal fragrance you’re after.
